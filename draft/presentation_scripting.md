Based on your comprehensive Berlin Rent Index vs. Inflation analysis, here's a tailored presentation structure with script guidance and visualization strategies:
	
### Presentation Outline (12 Slides, 8-10 Minutes)
**Color Coding Strategy:**  
- Blue = Rent data  
- Orange = Inflation  
- Red = Key insights  
- Green = Methodology  

---

#### **Slide 1: Title Slide**  
*Visual:* Berlin skyline + rent/inflation icons  
*Script:*  
> "Today we solve a critical housing question: Does Berlin's regulated base rent track inflation? Using 18 years of official data, we'll reveal why tenants feel squeezed despite 'stable' rents."  

---

#### **Slide 2: Problem & Hypothesis**  
*Visual:* Side-by-side icons (rent contract vs. inflation chart)  
*Script:*  
> "Tenants face rising costs, but regulated *Kaltmiete* (base rent) appears stable. Our core question: **Does it systematically match inflation?**  
> - H₀: μ_rent = μ_inflation  
> - H₁: μ_rent ≠ μ_inflation"  

---

#### **Slide 3: Data Sourcing & Key Distinction**  
*Visual:* Sourced logos (Berlin Senate + World Bank) + Kaltmiete/Warmmiete diagram  
*Script:*  
> "We merged **10 biennial Mietspiegel reports** with **World Bank inflation data**. Critical clarification: *Kaltmiete* excludes utilities – a key factor in tenant costs!"  
*Tip:* Show side-by-side data samples  

---

#### **Slide 4: Preprocessing Pipeline**  
*Visual:* Flowchart with icons:  
```mermaid
[CSV] → [Quality Translation] → [Biennial Aggregation] → [Inflation Compounding]
```  
*Script:*  
> "Standardized location ratings (low/medium/high), calculated city-wide medians, and compounded annual inflation to match rent periods."  

---

#### **Slide 5: Key Visualization - Trend Comparison**  
*Visual:* Dual-axis line chart  
- Primary: Rent Δ% (blue) vs. Inflation Δ% (orange)  
- Secondary: Energy inflation (red spikes)  
*Script:*  
> **"7 of 9 periods show rent exceeding inflation** – yet statistically insignificant! Note 2021-2023: Inflation spiked 13.2% on energy while rent grew just 5.4%."  
*Annotation:* Circle 2021-2023 divergence  

---

#### **Slide 6: Methodology Framework**  
*Visual:* 3-step diagram:  
1. Biennial Δ% calculation  
2. Paired t-test  
3. Effect size (Cohen's d)  
*Script:*  
> "We compared within-period changes using paired statistical tests – critical because rent and inflation move through the same economic conditions."  

---

#### **Slide 7: Statistical Results**  
*Visual:* Clean table with metrics:  
| Metric | Value | Interpretation |  
|--------|-------|----------------|  
| p-value | 0.298 | Fail to reject H₀ |  
| Cohen's d | 0.37 | Medium effect |  
| Power | 16.6% | Low detection |  
*Script:*  
> **"No statistical significance** (p=0.298) but **medium practical effect** (d=0.37). Our analysis was underpowered – we'd need 59 periods for reliable detection!"  

---

#### **Slide 8: The Affordability Paradox**  
*Visual:* Two-panel diagram:  
Left: Stable Kaltmiete (blue shield)  
Right: Volatile utilities (red explosion) → Warmmiete crisis  
*Script:*  
> "Here's the paradox: **Regulated base rent remains stable, but unregulated utilities drive actual costs.** Tenants experience inflation through energy, not rent!"  

---

#### **Slide 9: Limitations & Future Research**  
*Visual:* Icon trio with brief text:  
1. 🕒 Only 9 periods  
2. 📊 Methodology changes  
3. 🔥 Energy/inflation mismatch  
*Script:*  
> "For deeper insights, we'd need district-level analysis and real-time scraping of rental platforms – beyond our current scope."  

---

#### **Slide 10: Conclusion & Policy Implications**  
*Visual:* Large text:  
> "Kaltmiete ≠ Inflation Tracking  
> but  
> Stability ≠ Affordability"  
*Script:*  
> "While base rent doesn't track inflation statistically, its stability is a policy success. Yet **utility volatility demands separate regulation** to address true affordability."  

---

#### **Slide 11: Q&A + Repository**  
*Visual:* GitHub QR code + key contact  
*Script:*  
> "Explore our complete analysis: [GitHub Link]. Let's discuss how this methodology could apply to other cities!"  

---

#### **Slide 12: Backup - Energy Cost Disconnect**  
*Visual:* Table comparing periods:  
| Period | Rent Δ% | Inflation Δ% | Energy Δ% |  
|--------|---------|--------------|-----------|  
| 2021-2023 | +5.4% | +13.2% | +34.7% |  
*Script:*  
> "When energy costs spike, Kaltmiete remains stable – explaining why tenants feel disconnected from 'official' rent statistics."

### Visualization Optimization Checklist
1. **Biennial Comparison Plot:**  
   - Add direct value labels above bars  
   - Use dotted line for energy inflation  
   - Annotate with: "Regulation caps rent during crises"  

2. **Statistical Results Table:**  
   - Add power benchmark (80%) as red line  
   - Use color gradient (green→yellow→red) for p-values  

3. **Paradigm Diagram:**  
   - Convert mermaid to professional illustration  
   - Add tenant icon between panels  

4. **Data Source Slide:**  
   - Embed small map showing Berlin districts  
   - Use official logos for credibility

### Speaking Script Pro Tips
1. **Hook Early:**  
   > "If you've rented in Berlin, you've felt the squeeze. Our data shows why: base rent and inflation move to different beats!"  

2. **Explain Jargon:**  
   > "Kaltmiete = pure space cost. Warmmiete = what you actually pay. This gap is where the pain happens!"  

3. **Statistical Storytelling:**  
   > "The numbers say 'no difference' but the effect size whispers 'look closer' – and when we did, we found the energy disconnect!"  

4. **Practical Close:**  
   > "For policymakers: regulate utilities, not just rent. For researchers: replicate this with district-level data!"

### Recommended Visualization Tools
- **Static Plots:** Seaborn/Matplotlib (use `plt.style.use('seaborn-whitegrid')`)  
- **Interactive Elements:** Plotly Dash (for district-level drill-downs)  
- **Diagrams:** Draw.io or Mermaid Live Editor  
- **Color Palette:** 
  ```python
  rent_color = "#1f77b4"      # Blue
  inflation_color = "#ff7f0e" # Orange
  energy_color = "#d62728"    # Red
  ```
